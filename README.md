# flask-ml-demo
A demo Flask app that provides image classification (implemented in Keras) via an HTML page

This is essentially an "alpha" version of the [mnist_painter](https://github.com/DragonDuck/mnist_painter) app, except that this version allows users to upload images instead of drawing them. This essentially serves as a prototype for file uploads into a Flask/Django app (I don't know if this is best practices, though!)
